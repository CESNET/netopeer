Introduction
============

The Netopeer multi-level NETCONF server follows architecture described at
[http://libnetconf.googlecode.com/git/doc/doxygen/html/da/db3/server.html].
The source codes of this application can be found in the project Git repository
inside the `/server/` directory. From here, this server is referred as the
_Netopeer server_.

The Netopeer server is the main part of the Netopeer project. It uses
libnetconf [1] for handling NETCONF messages and applying operations. Running in
background as a system daemon, it allows centralized access to managed devices.
It allows multiple access from clients through agents connected through the
D-Bus [2] system message bus or UNIX sockets (when compiled with
--disable-dbus option).

Netopeer server utilize libnetconf transAPI [3] modules to control devices (from
here, referred as the _Netopeer modules_). The default module, called Netopeer,
is responsible for managing other Netopeer modules specified in the Netopeer
configuration data (more described below).

To correctly understand how to modify a configuration data in a NETCONF
datastore, user should be familiar with the NETCONF protocol [4] and YANG
language [5]. To communicate with the server and operate with the configuration
data, the Netopeer project includes the netopeer-cli(1) program.

Requirements
============

Before compiling the source code, make sure that your system provides the
following libraries or applications. Some of them are optional or can be
avoided in cost of missing of some feature - see the notes for the specific
item. All requirements are checked by the configure script.

- compiler (gcc, clang,...) and standard headers
- pkg-config
- libpthreads
- libxml2 (including headers from the devel package)
- libnetconf (including headers from the devel package)
- libdbus (including headers from the devel package)
 - can be omitted by --disable-dbus configure's option. In that case standard
   UNIX sockets are used for communication between netopeer-server(8) and
   netopeer-agent(1)s.
- python 2.7 or higher with the following modules:
 - os, string, re, argparse, subprocess, inspect, importlib, curses, xml, libxml2
 - if using --enable-tls option also - M2Crypto, shutil, signal
- sshd
 - openSSH's SSH server, make sure that the correct path to this binary is part
   of your PATH environment variable or use --with-sshd=/path/to/sshd configure's
   option.
- stunnel
 - required only when the TLS transport is enabled by --enable-tls option.
   Make sure that the correct path to this binary is part of your PATH
   environment variable or use --with-stunnel=/path/to/stunnel configure's
   option.
- roff2html
 - optional, used for building HTML version of man pages (make doc)
- rpmbuild
 - optional, used for building RPM package (make rpm).


Instalation
===========

Notorious sequence

 ./configure && make && make install

will configure, build project and install the following binaries:
 netopeer-server(8)       - the Netopeer server
 netopeer-agent(1)        - NETCONF agent running as an SSH subsystem and
                            comunicating with the Netopeer server over D-Bus or
                            UNIX socket.
 netopeer-manager(1)      - tool used to manage the Netopeer modules
 netopeer-configurator(1) - tool used for the Netopeer server first run
                            configuration (mainly focus on NACM section)

*Note*
Do not change SSH daemon settings. The Netopeer server uses its own instance of
the SSH daemon which is configured via NETCONF according to the
ietf-netconf-server data model. By default, the server will listen on port 830,
so it is good to make sure that no other application (including the default SSH
daemon) does not use this port.

Generic User Access
-------------------

This section describes how to specify a group of users allowed to communicate
with the netopeer-server(8). This can be done by limiting users allowed to use
intercommunication channel between netopeer-agent(1) and netopeer-server(8).
There are two possibilities of intercommunication: D-Bus and Unix sockets.

By default, all users are allowed to use intercommunication channel. If you
prefer to limit this access, use --with-group option of the configure script.

D-Bus
~~~~~

D-Bus is a default intercommunication channel. In this case, access control is
specified in the D-Bus configuration file for Netopeer
service org.liberouter.netopeer.conf (usually
/etc/dbus-1/system.d/org.liberouter.netopeer.conf). Netopeer allows user to
a) allow access to anybody or b) specify a single group with granted access.
The group can be specified via configure's --with-group option or via
Intercommunication section in netopeer-configurator(1). However, D-Bus
configuration allows you to specify more groups or just specific users with
access to the service. For more information, see the D-Bus configuration file
description.

UNIX socket
~~~~~~~~~~~

UNIX socket is an alternate communication channel when D-Bus cannot be used. To
switch to the UNIX socket communication, use configure's --disable-dbus option.
In this case, user access to the communication channel is done via access rights
to the socket file. Therefore, is it possible to allow access to all users (by
default) or limit it to a single group (with the configure's --with-group
option). Furthermore, this setting is compiled into the netopeer-server(8) and
it can be changed only by recompiling Netopeer server with different value to
the --with-group option.

Usage
=====

Managing the Netopeer modules
-----------------------------

The Netopeer server needs a configuration XML file for each module with path to
a .so file, paths to data models and datastore. To manage the Netopeer modules,
there is the netopeer-manager(1) tool. For more information about using this
tool, see the man page:

 man netopeer-manager

First run configuration
-----------------------

Before the starting netopeer-server(8), we recommend to configure it using the
netopeer-configurator(1) tool. It takes information from the compilation process
and allows you to change (or at least to show) various netopeer-server(8)
settings.

The following subsections describes what you can change using
netopeer-configurator(1).

Netopeer
~~~~~~~~

This section shows where the Netopeer binaries were installed. Furthermore, it
allows user to disable/enable the Netopeer modules added by netopeer-manager(1).

NACM
~~~~

This section covers NETCONF Access Control Module configuration. By default NACM
avoids any write to the configuration data. To change this, the user can set here
the default write action or specify the user(s) with unlimited access. There are
more configuration switches including a possibility to completely turn off the
NACM.

Intercommunication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tab provides information about used communication technology between the
Netopeer server and agents. Currently, there are two possibilities: D-Bus and
UNIX sockets. In case of D-Bus, user can specify here permissions what users
group is allowed to connect to the Netopeer server. In case of UNIX sockets,
this setting can be changed only by recompiling the server with different
value of the --with-group option. When the Netopeer server is compiled without
this option, access to the Netopeer server is not limited. However, there is
NACM which can be used to fine-grained access control.

Server Certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If compiled with TLS support, this module shows the currently used server
certificate by stunnel(8) for authentication. It can then be replaced by another.

CA Certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If compiled with TLS support, this module displays CA certificates used by
stunnel(8) when authenticating clients. It is also possible to add and remove
certificates from here.

CRLs
~~~~

If compiled with TLS support, this module displays CRLs used by stunnel(8)
to check for revocated certificates during verification. CRLs can also be
added and deleted here.

Starting the server
-------------------

If the server was compiled with --with-dbus-services option, the
netopeer-server(8) is started automatically by D-Bus with the first incoming
connection. Otherwise, it must be started manually.

# netopeer-server -d

The -d option makes the server to start in a daemon mode. You can also set
logging verbosity by specifying parameter for the -v option from 0 to 3 (errors,
warnings, verbose, debug).

When the Netopeer server starts, it automatically initiate the Netopeer build-in
module. The module loads its startup configuration and manages all other modules
added by the netopeer-manager(1) tool. When the module is added, it is enabled
by default. To disable starting a specific module, netopeer-configurator(1) can
be used or it can be done directly via NETCONF modifying the Netopeer's
configuration data.
